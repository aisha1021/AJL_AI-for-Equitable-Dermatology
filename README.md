## **üèóÔ∏è Project Overview**

This competition, part of the Break Through Tech AI program in collaboration with the **Algorithmic Justice League**, focuses on a critical issue in dermatology AI: **underperformance for darker skin tones**.

Our goal was to train a machine learning model capable of classifying **21 different skin conditions** across various skin tones, ensuring fairness and accuracy in medical AI applications.

---

## **üìä Data Exploration**

### **Dataset Overview:**
* Utilized the official **Kaggle AJL dataset**, a subset of the **FitzPatrick17 dataset** (~17,000 dermatology images labeled with skin conditions and Fitzpatrick skin types).
* Investigated **class imbalance** across **skin condition labels** and **skin tone categories**.
* The dataset consists of approximately **4500 images** representing **21 skin conditions** from the **FitzPatrick17k dataset**, which contains over 100 dermatological conditions.
* Images are sourced from two reputable dermatology websites: **DermaAmin** and **Atlas Dermatologico**.
* The dataset contains a **range of skin tones** based on the **Fitzpatrick skin type (FST)** scale (from **1 to 6**), with **Skin Tone 2** being the most represented and **Skin Tones 5 and 6** being underrepresented.

### **Key Data Insights:**

#### **Visualizations:**

1. **Skin Condition Distribution (Before Augmentation)**  
   This chart shows the distribution of different skin conditions in the dataset before data augmentation. There is a noticeable class imbalance, with conditions like **squamous-cell-carcinoma**, **basal-cell-carcinoma**, and **folliculitis** being more prevalent, while conditions such as **seborrheic-keratosis** and **basal-cell-carcinoma-morpheiform** are underrepresented.

2. **Skin Tone Distribution (Before Augmentation)**  
   The dataset is also imbalanced across skin tones, with **Skin Tone 2** (Fitzpatrick scale) being the most represented, followed by **Skin Tone 3** and **Skin Tone 1**. Skin tones **5** and **6** are significantly underrepresented.

3. **Skin Condition Distribution (After Augmentation)**  
   After applying data augmentation, the classes were balanced. Augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, and brightness/contrast adjustments were used to create a more even distribution across the different conditions, allowing for better model training.

4. **Skin Tone Distribution (After Augmentation)**  
   The augmentation process also addressed the skin tone imbalance. All skin tones, especially **Skin Tone 1, 2, 3**, and **5**, were balanced to have approximately equal representation in the dataset, ensuring fairer model predictions across all skin tones.

#### **Preprocessing Techniques:**
* **Data Augmentation:** Techniques like flipping, rotation, and brightness/contrast adjustments were used to balance the skin tone representation across the dataset. This helped mitigate the underrepresentation of darker skin tones and rare skin conditions.
* **Normalization & Resizing:** Image sizes were standardized to consistent dimensions for model training. This included resizing all images to a fixed size to ensure compatibility across different models.

## **üß† Model Development**

### **üß¨ Models Used:**
We experimented with and fine-tuned various deep learning architectures:
* **ResNet50**
* **MobileNet**
* **NASNet**
* **EfficientNetB3 & EfficientNetB4**
* **DenseNet121**

### **üåÄ Training Strategy:**
* Used **transfer learning** and **fine-tuned** models on the AJL dataset.
* **Evaluation Metric:** Weighted **F1-score** (ensuring balanced performance across classes).

### **‚öôÔ∏è Ensemble Learning:**
* We built and trained each model **separately**, saving their trained states after a certain number of epochs.
* Later, we **combined the models** using both:
  - **Hard Voting:** Selected the most frequently predicted label across models.
  - **Soft Voting (best results):** Averaged model confidence scores and chose the highest probability class.
* The **best performing ensemble** consisted of:
  - **ResNet50 + EfficientNetB3 + EfficientNetB4 + DenseNet121**

Model Performance:
Below is the accuracy and loss curve of a single model (DenseNet121) during initial training and fine-tuning, which illustrates the improvement in performance across epochs.

## **Confusion Matrix Analysis of the Ensemble Model (Soft Voting)**

The confusion matrix for the ensemble model, which uses soft voting, provides valuable insights into its performance across different classes. Below are the key takeaways:

### **Class Confusion:**

- **Basal-cell-carcinoma-morpheiform** and **malignant-melanoma** are more frequently misclassified, as observed from the higher off-diagonal values in these rows and columns. This suggests that the model might struggle to differentiate between these particular classes.
  
- **Prurigo-nodularis**, **Dyshidrotic-eczema**, and **Dermatomyositis** show relatively higher accuracy, with fewer misclassifications, highlighting the model's better ability to identify these classes correctly.

### **Accuracy and Misclassification Patterns:**

- Overall, the model performs reasonably well in classifying some of the classes. However, the most frequent misclassifications occur between similar-looking or more challenging classes, as seen in the higher values in off-diagonal elements. This is typical in many multi-class classification tasks, especially with similar categories.

- The diagonal values of the matrix show the number of correct predictions for each class. The overall diagonal sum indicates a decent level of accuracy in the classification process, though the model could still be refined to reduce misclassifications, especially for harder-to-classify categories.

### **Implications for Model Improvement:**

- The soft voting method seems to have been effective in aggregating predictions from multiple models, boosting the overall performance. However, focusing on the more challenging classes (**Basal-cell-carcinoma-morpheiform** and **malignant-melanoma**) and further refining the model through techniques like class weighting or additional fine-tuning could further enhance performance.

- Visualizing the confusion matrix can guide efforts in identifying patterns of misclassification and can be used to focus on areas where the model struggles the most.

### **Confusion Matrix:**

The following is the confusion matrix showing how the ensemble model performed across different categories:
